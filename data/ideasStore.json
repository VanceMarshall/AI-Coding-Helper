Skylight is known for its simple, visually appealing, family-oriented calendar and photo display app, often on a dedicated device like a digital picture frame.\n\nHere's a brainstorm and practical options to consider:\n\n### Core Features to Replicate / Improve\n- **Shared Family Calendar**\n  - Real-time calendar updates synchronized across multiple users/devices.\n  - Easy event creation with photos, notes, and reminders.\n  - Color-coding by user or event type.\n  \n- **Photo and Message Sharing**\n  - Ability to post photos, messages, or notes to a shared family feed.\n  - Option to comment or react on shared items (light social interaction).\n  \n- **Simple & Attractive UI**\n  - Large, legible fonts geared toward family/kitchen visibility.\n  - Calendar views optimized for glanceability—monthly, weekly views.\n  \n- **Device Support**\n  - Support on both mobile (iOS/Android) and dedicated digital photo frame devices (if hardware integration is planned).\n  - Web app interface for broader access.\n  \n- **Notifications & Reminders**\n  - Push notifications for new events and messages.\n  - Reminder/alarm options for upcoming events.\n  \n- **Offline Access and Sync**\n  - Ability to view calendar and photos offline, syncing when back online.\n\n### Possible Enhancements Beyond Skylight\n- **Voice Input and Assistant Integration**\n  - Integration with Alexa, Google Assistant, or Siri for hands-free event creation or queries.\n  \n- **Meal Planning Integration**\n  - Adding meal planning and grocery lists linked to calendar events.\n  \n- **Advanced Sharing Controls**\n  - Permissions to control who can add/edit events or view photos.\n  \n- **Customizable Themes**\n  - Various skins and layouts for personalization.\n\n### Technical Considerations\n- **Backend**\n  - Use Firebase or Supabase for real-time database and user authentication.\n  - Alternatively, a Node.js + PostgreSQL backend with WebSocket support for realtime syncing.\n  \n- **Frontend**\n  - React Native or Flutter for cross-platform mobile apps.\n  - React or Vue for web app.\n  \n- **Hardware Integration (if applicable)**\n  - If targeting digital photo frames: consider platforms like Raspberry Pi + touchscreen.\n  - Use lightweight UI frameworks optimized for embedded devices.\n  \n- **Scalability and Privacy**\n  - Secure data storage with encryption.\n  - GDPR/CCPA compliance if targeting various regions.\n  \n- **Monetization Model**\n  - Freemium with premium features (extra storage, themes).\n  - One-time purchase or subscription.\n  - Device + app bundle if hardware is involved.\n\n### Next Steps\n1. **Define Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**\n   - Prioritize features: shared calendar + photo posting + notifications.\n   - Decide target platforms (mobile/web only or with hardware).\n   \n2. **Research APIs**\n   - Look into calendar APIs (Google Calendar integration?).\n   - Explore existing photo sharing/storage solutions (Google Photos, AWS).\n   \n3. **Design UI/UX**\n   - Sketch wireframes focusing on simplicity and clarity.\n   \n4. **Build a prototype**\n   - Start with a simple shared calendar app with user accounts and event creation.\n   - Add photo sharing as next step.\n   \n5. **User Testing**\n   - Get feedback from families or focus groups to refine usability.\n   \n6. **Plan for Scaling & Monetization**\n\nIf you want, I can help draft detailed requirements or architecture diagrams next!",
