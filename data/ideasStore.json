Here’s a focused brainstorm and some practical steps for enhancing the Metadata function in your ReadySetVO project:\n\n### Current Challenge:\n- Metadata function outputs only one Long Form title.\n- Shows a score (/10) but only for one option.\n- No metadata for Shorts (short form content) produced.\n- Need to review and likely improve the OpenAI prompt sent to generate richer, more varied metadata.\n\n---\n\n### Brainstorm & Suggestions:\n\n#### 1. **Prompt Improvement**\n- **Explicitly ask for multiple metadata options**: Modify the prompt to request a list (e.g., \"Please provide 3-5 title options\").\n- **Separate Long Form and Shorts metadata**: Clarify in the prompt that you want distinct metadata for long form and short form content.\n- **Include desired metadata formats**: Ask for titles, short descriptions, keywords, tags, and suggested social snippets.\n- **Scoring criteria clarity**: Ask the model to score each option with a rationale or explanation (e.g., relevancy, engagement potential).\n\nExample prompt snippet:\n```\nGenerate 3 long-form video titles and 3 short-form video titles on the topic [TOPIC]. For each title, provide a score out of 10 with a brief explanation. Also generate a short description and suggested tags for each title.\n```\n\n---\n\n#### 2. **Data Structure & API Enhancements**\n- Return metadata as a structured JSON array rather than a single string.\n- For example:\n```json\n{\n  \"longForm\": [\n    {\"title\": \"...\", \"score\": 8, \"description\": \"...\", \"tags\": [\"tag1\", \"tag2\"]},\n    ...\n  ],\n  \"shortForm\": [\n    {\"title\": \"...\", \"score\": 7, \"description\": \"...\", \"tags\": [\"tagA\", \"tagB\"]},\n    ...\n  ]\n}\n```\n- Update UI and backend to handle and display multiple results.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. **Testing & Iteration**\n- **Test with varied prompts and topics** to see if the model consistently produces multi-option outputs.\n- Log prompts and responses for review to refine prompt wording.\n- Consider adding temperature and max_tokens tuning for more diverse options.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. **Practical Next Steps**\n- Extract current prompt sent to OpenAI for the Metadata function.\n- Edit prompt to explicitly ask for multiple results and short form metadata.\n- Add validation in the code to handle multiple options and parse scores.\n- Update UI to display a list of options with scores.\n- Implement fallback or retry if multiple options are not returned.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. **Optional Feature Add-ons**\n- Allow user to select favorite options and save them.\n- Provide an “Explain score” tooltip for user learning.\n- Integrate real-world performance data (clicks, views) later to improve scoring accuracy.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, you can share the current prompt you’re sending to OpenAI, and I can help rewrite it concretely!"
